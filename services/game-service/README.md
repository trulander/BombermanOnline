# Game Service
[![Russian](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-Russian-blue)](README_RU.md)

The Game Service is a key component of the Bomberman Online platform, responsible for all game process logic. It manages game creation, player connections, game event processing, game state updates, and interaction with other services.

## Key Features

-   **Game Session Management:** Create, configure, start, pause, and end games via REST API.
-   **Game Mode Support:** Campaign, Free-for-all, Capture the Flag with customizable parameters.
-   **Player Management:** Add/remove players, manage their state, and process input.
-   **Team System:** Create teams, automatic player distribution, scoring system.
-   **Combat System:** Use various types of weapons (bombs, bullets, mines).
-   **Map Management:** Generate random maps, load from templates and chains via REST API.
-   **Artificial Intelligence:** Manage enemies and their behavior.
-   **Power-up System:** Power-ups to improve player characteristics.
-   **Real-time:** Interaction via NATS for asynchronous processing of game events.
-   **REST API:** Full management of games, teams, and maps.
-   **Persistence:** Store map data in PostgreSQL and cache in Redis.

## Technologies

-   **Programming Language:** Python 3.12
-   **Framework:** FastAPI
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL (for map storage)
-   **Cache:** Redis (for caching map data)
-   **Messaging System:** NATS
-   **ORM/Query Builder:** SQLAlchemy (asynchronous)
-   **Dependency Management and Build:** UV
-   **Database Migrations:** Alembic
-   **Containerization:** Docker
-   **Logging:** python-json-logger

## Installing Dependencies

The `uv` package manager is used to install dependencies.

1.  Make sure you have `uv` installed. If not, install it:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # for Linux/macOS
    # .venv\Scripts\activate    # for Windows
    ```
3.  Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` (while in the `services/game-service` directory):
    ```bash
    uv pip install .
    # or, if dev dependencies are needed and for editable installation:
    # uv pip install -e ".[dev]".
    ```

## Running the Service

### Local Run (for development)

1.  Make sure all necessary services are running: PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS. Their connection configuration is in the `.env` file (create it from `.env-example` if necessary in the `services/game-service` directory).
2.  Apply database migrations:
    From the `services/game-service` directory:
    ```bash
    uv run python app/manage.py migrate
    ```
3.  Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
    From the `services/game-service` directory:
    ```bash
    uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5002 --reload
    ```
    The service will be available at `http://localhost:5002`. API documentation (Swagger UI) will be available at `http://localhost:5002/games/docs`.

### API Endpoints

The service provides the following groups of REST API endpoints:

-   **Games (`/games/api/v1/games`):**
    -   `GET /` - Get a list of games with filtering
    -   `GET /{game_id}` - Get detailed game information
    -   `POST /` - Create a new game
    -   `PUT /{game_id}/settings` - Update game settings
    -   `PUT /{game_id}/status` - Change game status (start/pause/resume)
    -   `POST /{game_id}/players` - Add a player to the game
    -   `DELETE /{game_id}/players/{player_id}` - Remove a player from the game
    -   `DELETE /{game_id}` - Delete a game

-   **Teams (`/games/api/v1/teams`):**
    -   `GET /{game_id}` - Get game teams
    -   `POST /{game_id}` - Create a team
    -   `PUT /{game_id}/{team_id}` - Update a team
    -   `DELETE /{game_id}/{team_id}` - Delete a team
    -   `POST /{game_id}/{team_id}/players` - Add a player to a team
    -   `DELETE /{game_id}/{team_id}/players/{player_id}` - Remove a player from a team
    -   `POST /{game_id}/distribute` - Automatically distribute players into teams

-   **Maps (`/games/api/v1/maps`):**
    -   `POST /templates` - Create a map template
    -   `GET /templates` - Get a list of map templates
    -   `GET /templates/{id}` - Get a map template
    -   `PUT /templates/{id}` - Update a map template
    -   `DELETE /templates/{id}` - Delete a map template
    -   Similar operations for groups (`/groups`) and chains (`/chains`) of maps

Detailed API documentation can be found in [docs/en/api_endpoints.md](docs/en/api_endpoints.md).

### Running with Docker

1.  **Build Docker Image:**
    While in the `services/game-service` directory, run:
    ```bash
    docker build -t bomberman-game-service .
    ```
2.  **Run Docker Container:**
    (Example, requires running PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS and appropriate Docker network configuration. Environment variables can be passed via `-e` or a file)
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5002:5002 \
           --env-file .env \ # Make sure .env file is configured for Docker environment
           bomberman-game-service
    ```
    For a full Docker run, it is recommended to use `docker-compose.yml` from the project root directory, which manages all services and their configurations.

## Environment Variables

The service is configured using environment variables. An example file with environment variables can be found in `services/game-service/.env-example`. Key variables:

-   `API_V1_STR`: Prefix for API V1.

-   `DEBUG`, `RELOAD`: Debug and reload flags for Uvicorn.
-   `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: PostgreSQL connection settings.
-   `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_DB`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Redis connection settings.
-   `NATS_URL`: URL for connecting to NATS.
-   `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FORMAT`, `TRACE_CALLER`: Logging settings.
